# Rorschach for Deep Learning
A simple assessment of the most popular image classifiers using the famous Rorschach Test cards.

### Resources

### Requirements
Make sure you use Keras >= 2.2.0 for all of the libraries.
I recommend Tensorflow >= 1.7.0, otherwise you might get an error related to the axis parameter of the softmax activation.
